Problem:

Assume the oil production industry is competitive, that there is a fixed
known amount R in reserves, and aggregate demand for oil in period t =
1, 2, . . . , is given by Dt = D(pt ) > 0 with Dâ€² < 0. Assume also that all
producers agree that prices in each period is determined by a sequence {pt },
t = 1, 2, . . .
i) Show that
pt+1 = (1 + i)pt ,

(1)

where i is the real interest rate.
ii) In less than 10 lines list reasons why equation (1) does not describe
the behavior of actual oil prices.

Problem

Explain, in less than 20 lines, how data on wind trajectories can be used to
identify the casual effect of the loss of Leaf Area Index in one area of the
Amazon forest on other areas.

True, False or Uncertain - justify your answer
in less than 10 lines.
i) A decrease in the pure rate of time preference increases the Social Cost
of Carbon.
ii) The correlation of changes in deforestation across sites can be used to
measure the effect of deforestation in one area on other areas.

iii) Existing technologies are capable of controlling illegal deforestation in
tropical forests at a low cost.
iv) Countries far from the equator should have a negligible country social
cost of carbon.
v) The levelized cost of capital of nuclear is more sensitive to increases
in interest rates than the levelized cost of capital of solar
